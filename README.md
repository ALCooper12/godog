# Godog

**Godog** is an open source behavior-driven development framework for [go][golang] programming language.
What is behavior-driven development, you ask? Itâ€™s the idea that you start by writing human-readable sentences that
describe a feature of your application and how it should work, and only then implement this behavior in software.

The project is inspired by [behat][behat] and [cucumber][cucumber] and is based on cucumber [gherkin specification][gherkin].

### Be aware that

The work is still in progress and is not functional yet, neither it is intended for production usage.
The general public API may brake.
